Oxidation KInetics Data Analysis (OKiDA) automates the data analysis of isothermal oxidation kinetics from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data files. OKiDA calculates the rate law constant (n), reaction rate coefficient (Kp), reaction rate constant (Mo), and attempts to identify the steady-state and transient behaviour from experimental mass-time data. OKiDA also calculates the material's oxidation activation energy (Ea) and Arrhenious constant (A) through the temperature range covered by the supplied isothermal data sets. OKiDA presents the user with the opportunity to apply a linear regression model (OLS, WLS, progated error, pooled variance error, HLM, etc.) specific to the experimental design (number of repeat measurements, etc.). OKiDA is intended to be stand-alone: analyzing the oxidation kinetics of a collection of datasets produced by multiple isothermal TGA experiments at differing and/or the same temperature.
